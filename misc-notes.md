job tracker ideas/notes: 
    can let user set a goal of how many jobs or leetcode questions that they completed and have this tracked 
        -reference sec 12: bonus challenge on the Django One-to-Many Models & ModelForms lesson 
            + rather than checking against the length of the choices tuple just check against some daily goal that the user can set (store in random variable) 

search query 
    allow for users to perform a search on a website for keywords included in post content/title/tags and subforum title(or topic)/tags 
    this functionality will probably be inclusive of allowing users to filter by tags
        -for instance if we wanted to allow users to be able to click on a tag and see all related posts/subforums
